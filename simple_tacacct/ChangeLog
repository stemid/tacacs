2015-10-26 simple_tacacct  v1.0.0 Dave Olson <olson@cumulusnetworks.com>

	First revision:

	This shared library has is designed to do very simple TACACS+ accounting.
	It is designed to be used via dlopen, and to have a single function.

	The caller calls the routine with a buffer of the "command" to be sent as
	an accounting record, once with 1 as first argument to send a "start"
	record, and then at the end with 0 as first argument to send a "stop"
	record.

	All config is handed within the library.   See acct_test.c for a simple
	example of the usage.
